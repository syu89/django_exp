# To record my learning experience, DJANGO + PYTHON

## 13 Mar, 2020

I'm in Wuhan, yes the breakout place of the 2019-nCov. I've stayed at home for more than one month. 

But I'm still working remotely, handling regular routings. 

I decide to gain a new skill, Django and python. 

When the desease passes away, I hope to finish my first project. ^_^
